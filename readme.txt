## Edmonds' blossom shrinking algorithm

* Insert the graph in adjacency matrix formats in a text file
* Pass the text file through command line argument like
```
./a.out graph.txt
```
* The maximum matching array will be shown as output where if 
vertex a is matched with vertex b  then it will be shown as a[b] b[a]
if a vetex v is not matched with any other vertex then v[-1] will be
shown.
